            <h2>Company</h2>
            <p>
              New West Investment Management, Inc. was created to meet
              investors’ needs by combining personal financial service with
              professional investment results. Founded in 1990 by Peter V.
              Hedberg, New West is a registered investment advisor that manages
              separate investment portfolios on a discretionary, fee-only basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              The mission of New West Investment Management, Inc. is to assist
              our clients in building permanent, long-term wealth in order to
              create and preserve financial independence. We think in terms of
              financial independence rather than of retirement. More...
            </p>
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
              New West uses a four-step method that promotes education and
              understanding regarding our clients’finances. Our process outlines
              investment objectives, identifies resources, provides investment
              management, and tracks results. This foundation supports our
              clients in achieving their investment goals. More...
            </p>
            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>
              Our investment approach utilizes a deep understanding of the
              elements of asset pricing, ranging from governmental policies and
              stability to economic factors including interest rate structure
              and expectations for growth. These macroeconomic factors guide our
              portfolio asset allocation decisions. More...
            </p>
            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
              New West seeks to identify mispriced securities. When buying
              shares of a company we look for abnormally profitable businesses
              that have a sustainable advantage. We construct investment
              portfolios, using individual securities in most cases, to increase
              transparency and to decrease risk, fees, and taxes. More...
            </p>
            <h2>Personal Attention, Professional Results</h2>
            <p>
              Our attitude towards personal service allows us to understand
              client needs in great detail, to tailor a portfolio suited to
              those needs, and to communicate information in a fashion that
              enhances our clients’ understanding and comfort with their wealth.
              Our professional results on a risk-adjusted basis result from
              long-term focus on large and small factors in a world increasingly
              focused on the short-term. We manage your money like we do our
              own. Our clients’ trust and understanding in how we manage their
              portfolios allows us to invest for their success.
